<h2>Now Let’s Talk about what they do and how to work with them</h2>

<h4><b>>Upper-case</b></h4>
<i> Let's suppose You have a column where all letter in each or in some cell is in lower case or any other case and you need to convert them into Upper Case (ABC DEF), at that time upper-case add-ins will help you just select the whole column or a range and click on upper-case it will convert all letters which are present in the selected range to Upper Case at once.</i>

<h4><b>>Lower-case </b></h4>
<i> Let's suppose You have a column where all letter in each or in some cell is in upper case or any other case and you need to convert them into lower Case (abc def), at that time lower-case add-ins will help you just select the whole column or a range and click on Lower-case it will convert all letters which are present in the selected range to Lower Case at once.</i>

<h4><b>>Proper-Case</b></h4>
<i> Let's suppose You have a column where all letter in each or in some cell is in upper case or any other case and you need to convert them into Proper Case (Abc Def), at that time Proper-case add-ins will help you just select the whole column or a range and click on Proper-case it will convert all letters which are present in the selected range to Lower Case at once. It’s one of the most useful add-ins because when we put data in Excel, sometimes put it in lower case, and it's very annoying to rewrite it with the proper case it also decreases our working speed and sometimes, we didn’t notice this problem  so to deal with it use this add-in just write your all data in lower case then this add-in will change it Lower Case to Proper Case. </i>

<h4><b>>Remove</b></h4>
<i>Now let's suppose you are given some values like this-  “123-456-789”(as an example) and you are said to remove “-“ from this number and submit the data sheet as soon as possible then  'Remove' add-in will help you to do that just by a click, just select the range (where you want to the operation) and click on this add-in, a form will appear to which will ask you that what do you want to remove from the range and click on Done button and success Message box will appear just click ok and see your problem is solved.</i>

<h4><b>>Exchange</b></h4>
<i>This add-in logic is very simple it just replaces the value with the desired value (like Replace ), But in case of 'Exchange' it replaces values from a selected range at once. In order to use it just select a range or a single cell and then click on it, a form will appear it will ask for two inputs, put your desired input and click on Replace and see what happens. </i>
